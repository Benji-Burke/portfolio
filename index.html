                <h2>About:</h2>
                <p>I recently graduated from the web immersive program at General Assembly, where my passion for web
                    design really took off!
                    You can see my previous work history on Linked In. Outside of web design I like to travel to new
                    places, hike outdoors and
                    watch numerous forms of entertainment. I've worked on projects from front end apps to back end
                    servers. Languages I've worked in are javascript, ruby on rails
                    and react, plus many more! I am confident,

                <h1>Front-end Developer</h1>
                <p>I love to code and design websites from scratch, because I enjoy seeing the work I bring to the
                    browser.</p>

                <h1>Back-End</h1>
                <p>When I first started at General Assembly, I had no idea what I was getting my self into! I thought
                    we'd only be working on the front end aspectof website building. Once we got into learning node, and
                    moving on to rails I started loving working in the backend.</p>

        <img src="/cryptoSeek.png" />
        <p class="ReadMe">GA_Project
            Our first project for General Assembly!

            CryptoSeek, is a cryptocurrency research tool. It allows you to search the top 100 coins in the current
            market powered by the cryptoCompare api!

            The website calls the api to display the top 100 coins displaying the name, symbol, current price and
            current marketCap!

            There are three links in the navigation that lead you to numerous pages and websites to help you learn about
            the exciting world of blockchain!

            Eventually links will be added to go to each coin.

            My thought process was to get the data, publish in a table to show the current top 100 coins in the market.
            I had to call the api with ajax, create a loop that not only created the rows and necessary data cells but
            also print out the data at the same time!

            At first I had this problem where my loops created all the rows with whatever the specified number was, but
            it would also print out the data that same number of times. I had two loops working under one functiion. The
            first was to create the rows and add them to the table body. The second loop was to create the data for the
            coins. Two loops were one on top of the other. When I would execute them I had problems. For example if I
            wanted it to create 100 rows of data, 100 rows would be printed, but the data would also grab 100 coins and
            print those 100 times but in each row! I would have 100 rows filled with 100 coins in each row!

            My soluton was to just create one loop that printed 100 rows along with the necessary data. It's a long
            block of code but it works.

            Future plans that I want to implement? There are a lot of things that I'd like to add. I want to polish it
            up visually, There are a couple of things that I need to fix too. On the resource page the title of the
            website isn't white like it's suppose too. I want to add links for every coin that is produced so when the
            user clicks on them it brings them to a page bio of the coin. I want to add a search function that allows a
            user to search a top 100 coin.</p>
